    2. A young shoot of a plant; a spear.

Vivespire is a discreet event simulator for
biological systems. It is inteded to provide an
engine for realistic, scalable simulations of
living entities powered by research-based
physiological models.

## Development Plans

1. Provide the layers needed for effective Human
   simulation.
2. Create the base Human Sim
3. Construct some basic models for Human simulation.
    - Heart / Circulation
    - Digestion
    - Wounds / Healing
    - Maybe more...
