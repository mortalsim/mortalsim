# MORTALSIM-CORE

This is the core crate of the MortalSim project,
a discreet event simulator for biological systems.

## Motivation

Existing physiological simulation solutions are very
complex, computationally expensive, and/or difficult
to understand and modify. 

There is need for an adaptable software solution to
provide efficient determination of overall, high-level
physiological state which can make good use of existing,
clinically verified models.
